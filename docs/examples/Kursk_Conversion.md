## Map Overview

### Original BF1942 Kursk

**Game:** Battlefield 1942
**Mode:** Conquest
**Era:** World War 2 - Eastern Front
**Theme:** Open plains with strategic capture points

**Gameplay:**
- Two main bases (Axis north, Allies south)
- Two neutral capture points (Lumber Mill, Central Ammo)
- Both bases have airfields (fighters + dive bombers)
- Mix of tanks, APCs, scout cars, and artillery
- Large-scale tank battles across open terrain

### Layout

```
       NORTH (Axis Base)
            ↓
    [Airfield: Fighter + Bomber]
            ↓
      [Axis Base HQ]
    (5 infantry spawns)
    (7 vehicle spawners)
            ↓
            ↓
    [Lumber Mill CP] ← WEST        EAST →
        (3 spawns)
    (3 vehicle spawners)
            ↓
    [Central Ammo CP]

## Conversion Process

### Step 1: Data Extraction

**Source files extracted:**
```
Kursk/
├── Init.con
├── StaticObjects.con (330KB - 1510 objects!)
├── Heightmap.raw (128KB - 256×256)
├── Conquest/
│   ├── ObjectSpawns.con       # 18 vehicle spawners
│   ├── SoldierSpawns.con      # 15 infantry spawn points
│   ├── ControlPoints.con      # 4 control points
│   └── *Templates.con         # Definitions
└── ...
```

**Key data parsed:**
- 4 control points (2 bases + 2 neutral)
- 15 infantry spawn points
- 18 vehicle spawners
- 1510 static objects

### Step 2: Asset Mapping

**Mapping database:** `tools/asset_audit/bf1942_to_portal_mappings.json` (733 mappings)

**Results:**
- **Mapped:** 1439 objects (95.3%)
- **Skipped:** 71 objects (4.7%)
  - Water bodies (Portal has limited water support)
  - Terrain-only elements (rocks, grass clusters)
  - Duplicate/overlapping objects

**Example mappings:**
```json
{
  "lighttankspawner": {
    "portal_equivalent": "VEH_Leopard",
    "category": "vehicle",
    "fallbacks": {
      "MP_Tungsten": "VEH_M1A2"
    }
  },
  "heavytankspawner": {
    "portal_equivalent": "VEH_M1A2",
    "category": "vehicle"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Coordinate Transformation

**Challenges:**
1. BF1942 uses arbitrary origin (not centered)
2. N-S orientation doesn't match Portal's E-W terrains
3. Height differences between Refractor and Portal

**Transformations applied:**

1. **Offset Calculation:**
   ```
   BF1942 map center: (538.49, 0.0, 544.17)
   Offset: (-538.49, 0.0, -544.17)
   Result: Objects centered at (0, 0, 0)
   ```

2. **Axis Swap (swap_xz):**
   ```
   N-S layout → E-W layout
   X becomes Z, Z becomes X
   Required for MP_Tungsten terrain orientation
   ```

3. **Height Adjustment:**
   ```
   +15 meters vertical offset
   Matches MP_Tungsten terrain elevation
   Prevents underground spawning
   ```

### Step 4: Scene Generation

**Generated structure:**
```
Kursk.tscn
├── TEAM_1_HQ (Axis)
│   ├── HQ_Team1 (40m × 40m protection zone)
│   ├── SpawnPoint_1_1 through SpawnPoint_1_5
│   └── Transform: (-305.783, 92.8547, -101.171)
├── TEAM_2_HQ (Allies)
│   ├── HQ_Team2 (40m × 40m protection zone)
│   ├── SpawnPoint_2_1 through SpawnPoint_2_4
│   └── Transform: (305.783, 91.6406, 29.5715)
├── CapturePoint_3 (Lumber Mill)
│   ├── OpenSpawnPoint_3_10 through 3_12
│   └── Associated: AA gun, 2 artillery
├── CapturePoint_4 (Central Ammo)
│   ├── openbasecammo_4_13 through 4_15
│   └── Associated: Heavy tank
├── CombatArea
│   └── CollisionPolygon3D (boundary polygon)
└── Static
    ├── MP_Tungsten_Terrain
    └── 1439 placed objects
```

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Spawn Point Count Discrepancy

**Problem:** Initial conversion created 8 spawn points per HQ (inauthentic).

**BF1942 Reality:**
- Axis: 5 spawn points
- Allies: 4 spawn points

**Root Cause:** Generator assumed standard 8-spawn setup.

**Solution:** Created `tools/fix_authentic_spawn_counts.py` to match exact counts.

---

### Challenge 2: Base Capture Points

**Problem:** CapturePoint_1 and CapturePoint_2 were at HQ locations.

**BF1942 Reality:**
- Base control points are HQs (not capturable)
- Only 2 neutral CPs are capturable (Lumber Mill, Central Ammo)

**Solution:** Created `tools/remove_base_capture_points.py` to remove base CPs.

---

### Challenge 3: Coordinate Misalignment

**Problem:** Objects offset from terrain, appearing to float.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Original Axis base position
BF1942: (437.315, 77.8547, 238.39)
Portal (before fix): (437.315, 77.8547, 238.39)  # Wrong!
# Outside combat area, misaligned
```

**Solution:** Applied offset to center map:
```bash
Offset: (-538.49, 0.0, -544.17)
Portal (after fix): (-101.171, 77.8547, -305.783)  # Centered!
```

Tool: `tools/apply_coordinate_offset.py`

---

### Challenge 4: Map Orientation

**Problem:** N-S layout didn't match E-W Portal terrain.

**BF1942 Layout:**
```
Axis (North)
    ↓
Allies (South)
```

**Portal Terrain (MP_Tungsten):**
```
← West          East →
```

**Solution:** Applied `swap_xz` transformation:
```python
def swap_xz(x, y, z):
    return (z, y, x)  # X becomes Z, Z becomes X
```

Tool: `tools/apply_axis_transform.py`

---

### Challenge 5: Height Adjustment

**Problem:** Objects spawning below terrain surface.

**Root Cause:**
- BF1942 Y-coordinates don't match Portal terrain
- Portal terrain has different elevation (MP_Tungsten ~15m higher)

**Solution:**
```python
# Raise all objects +15 meters
new_y = old_y + 15.0
```

**Additional fix:** Spawn points needed -5m relative adjustment:
```python
# Spawn points should be slightly below HQ
spawn_y = hq_y - 5.0
```

Tools:
- `tools/adjust_height.py`
- `tools/adjust_spawn_heights.py`

---

### Challenge 6: Spawn Point Positioning

**Problem:** Spawn points had absolute coordinates (scattered).

**BF1942 Reality:**
- Spawn points in 10m radius circle around HQ
- Evenly distributed for spawn spread

**Solution:** Reset spawn points to relative positions:
```python
radius = 10.0
angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_spawns
for i in range(num_spawns):
    angle = i * angle_step
    spawn_x = hq_x + radius * math.cos(angle)
    spawn_z = hq_z + radius * math.sin(angle)
    spawn_y = hq_y - 5.0  # Slightly below HQ
```

Tool: `tools/reset_spawn_points.py`

---

### Challenge 7: Missing HQ Protection Zones

**Problem:** No HQ_Team1/HQ_Team2 PolygonVolumes (players can't spawn).

**Portal Requirement:**
- HQ must have HQArea PolygonVolume
- Defines safe spawn zone
- Minimum 40m × 40m

**Solution:**
```python
# Create 40m × 40m square around HQ
hq_area_points = [
    Vector2(-20, -20),
    Vector2( 20, -20),
    Vector2( 20,  20),
    Vector2(-20,  20),
]
```

Tool: `tools/add_hq_areas.py`

---

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate initial .tscn
python3 tools/portal_convert.py --map Kursk --base-terrain MP_Tungsten

# 2. Apply coordinate offset
python3 tools/apply_coordinate_offset.py \
    --offset=-538.49,0,-544.17

# 3. Apply axis transform
python3 tools/apply_axis_transform.py --transform=swap_xz

# 4. Adjust height
python3 tools/adjust_height.py --offset=15.0

# 5. Reset spawn points
python3 tools/reset_spawn_points.py --radius=10

# 6. Adjust spawn heights
python3 tools/adjust_spawn_heights.py --offset=-5.0

# 7. Add HQ areas
python3 tools/add_hq_areas.py --size=40

# 8. Remove base capture points
python3 tools/remove_base_capture_points.py

# 9. Fix spawn counts
python3 tools/fix_authentic_spawn_counts.py \
    --axis=5 --allies=4
```

> 💡 **Note:** These tools were created during Phase 4 (Testing & Validation). Future conversions use the unified `portal_convert.py` which includes all these fixes automatically.

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Asset Mapping Database**
   - 733 pre-mapped assets saved significant time
   - Fallback system handled Portal's `levelRestrictions` automatically
   - 95.3% success rate exceeded expectations

2. **Modular Tools**
   - Individual fix tools allowed iterative refinement
   - Each tool focused on one problem (SOLID principle)
   - Easy to re-run when issues found

3. **Version Control**
   - Backups before each transformation step
   - Easy to roll back when experiments failed
   - Git history documented the journey

### What Was Challenging

1. **Coordinate System Discovery**
   - Took several iterations to find correct offset
   - Manual inspection in Godot required
   - **Lesson:** Build coordinate visualization tool

2. **Spawn Point Logic**
   - BF1942 has complex spawn point rules
   - Not all spawn points active simultaneously
   - **Lesson:** Study game mode logic more thoroughly

3. **Terrain Matching**
   - MP_Tungsten is flatter than original Kursk
   - Height differences noticeable without heightmap
   - **Lesson:** Always provide heightmap when possible

### Best Practices Discovered

1. **Start with Smallest Map**
   - Kursk is relatively simple (no major buildings)
   - Good for validating pipeline
   - **Recommend:** Start with Kursk, then try complex maps

2. **Verify in Stages**
   - Check spawn points first
   - Then vehicle spawners
   - Then static objects
   - **Reason:** Catches systematic errors early

3. **Use Godot Editor**
   - Visual verification catches issues
   - Top-down view shows layout clearly
   - **Tip:** Use View → Top frequently
