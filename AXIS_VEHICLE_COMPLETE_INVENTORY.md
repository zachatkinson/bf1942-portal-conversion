The Secret Weapons expansion added experimental and late-war German vehicles including:
- Jet aircraft (Me 262, Ho 229, Natter)
- Super-heavy tanks (Sturmtiger, captured T95)
- Wonder weapons (V-2 rockets, Wasserfall SAMs)
- Specialized transports (Schwimmwagen, R75)

## For BF6 Portal Conversion

When converting BF1942 maps to BF6 Portal, these AXIS vehicles will need to be mapped to equivalent BF6 assets. Priority mapping recommendations:

### High Priority (appear on most maps):
- PanzerIV â BF6 medium tank equivalent
- Tiger â BF6 heavy tank equivalent
- bf109 â BF6 fighter aircraft
- Stuka â BF6 dive bomber
- Kubelwagen â BF6 light transport

### Medium Priority (expansion-specific):
- Italian vehicles â Find WW2-era Italian equivalents in BF6
- Japanese naval â Map to modern naval vessels
- Secret Weapons â May need creative substitutions

### Low Priority (rare/unique):
- V2 Rocket â Scripted event or stationary prop
- Experimental aircraft â Modern jet equivalents
- Specialized transports â Generic transport vehicles
