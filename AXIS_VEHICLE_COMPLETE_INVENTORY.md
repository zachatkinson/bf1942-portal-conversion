## Notable Observations

### German Dominance
German forces appear on **all 36 maps**, making them the most represented AXIS faction. They have the widest variety of vehicles across all categories.

### Italian Limited Appearance
Italian vehicles only appear in the **Road to Rome** expansion (6 maps) and occasionally in **Secret Weapons** (Gothic Line, Raid on Agheila). They had the smallest vehicle roster of the three AXIS powers.

### Secret Weapons Variety
The Secret Weapons expansion added experimental and late-war German vehicles including:
- Jet aircraft (Me 262, Ho 229, Natter)
- Super-heavy tanks (Sturmtiger, captured T95)
- Wonder weapons (V-2 rockets, Wasserfall SAMs)
- Specialized transports (Schwimmwagen, R75)

### Missing Vehicles
Notable AXIS vehicles from WWII that were **NOT** included in BF1942:
- German U-boats (submarines)
- Panther tank
- King Tiger (Tiger II)

## For BF6 Portal Conversion

When converting BF1942 maps to BF6 Portal, these AXIS vehicles will need to be mapped to equivalent BF6 assets. Priority mapping recommendations:

### High Priority (appear on most maps):
- PanzerIV → BF6 medium tank equivalent
- Tiger → BF6 heavy tank equivalent
- bf109 → BF6 fighter aircraft
- Stuka → BF6 dive bomber
- Kubelwagen → BF6 light transport

### Medium Priority (expansion-specific):
- Italian vehicles → Find WW2-era Italian equivalents in BF6
- Japanese naval → Map to modern naval vessels
- Secret Weapons → May need creative substitutions

### Low Priority (rare/unique):
- V2 Rocket → Scripted event or stationary prop
- Experimental aircraft → Modern jet equivalents
- Specialized transports → Generic transport vehicles
